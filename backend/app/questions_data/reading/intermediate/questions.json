According to some studies, women and men ranging in age from seventeen to eighty described the range of topics each discussed with friends of the same sex. Certain topics were common to both men and women: work, movies, and television proved to be frequent topics for both groups. The differences between men and women were more striking than the similarities. Female friends spent much more time discussing personal and domestic subjects, relationship problems, family, health and reproductive matters, weight, food and clothing. Men, on the other hand, were more likely to discuss music, current events, sports and business. Women were more likely to gossip about close friends and family. By contrast, men spent more time gossiping about sports figures and media personalities. These differences can lead to frustration when men and women try to converse with one another.",

It looks like a lawn chair with wings, weighs no more than 254 pounds, flies up to 60 miles an hour, and carries about 5 gallons of fuel. Most ultralights are sold as kits and take about 40 hours to assemble. Flying an ultralight airplane is so easy that a pilot with no experience can fly one. Accidents are rarely fatal or even serious because the ultralight lands so slowly and gently and carries very little fuel. Some models now have parachutes attached, while others have parachute packs which pilots can wear.",

Severe earthquakes are most common near the edges of the \"plates\" in the Earth's crust, such as around the Pacific Ocean, along the Mid-Atlantic ridge and in the Mediterranean and South- West Asian regions. They occur when the plates move. So, the earthquakes are caused by volcanic action, explosions and other factors, and earthquakes under the sea trigger off huge waves called tsunamis.",

The term mother tongue, however, should not be interpreted to mean that it is the language of one's mother.

When they graduate from high school, many can use a computer, write essays with three-part theses, and differentiate equations. In addition to learning specific skills, they learn to think critically, to weigh evidence and to develop independent judgment. The extent to which this development takes place is related to both school and home environments. Teachers who are more open to new ideas and less authoritarian produce students who have greater intellectual flexibility and higher achievement test scores. Studies show that teachers are most demanding when they are of the same social class as their students. The greater the difference between their own social class and that of their pupils, the more rigidly they structure their classrooms and the fewer demands they place on their students.",

The red panda spends much of its time in trees but feeds on the ground, eating primarily bamboo leaves but also fruit and roots. The giant panda superficially resembles a bear. The body is chiefly white, and the limbs are brownish black, with the dark color extending up over the shoulder. The ears and eye patches are black. Giant pandas live in restricted areas of the high mountain bamboo forests of central China; their diet consists entirely of bamboo shoots. Rare in the wild, they produce young poorly when they are not in their natural environment. Giant pandas are protected by law in China.",

        "text": "One Chinese engineer, Youzhou Song, has designed an exciting solution to China's traffic congestion problems: the straddling bus (a bus which goes across and above part of the road, like a moving bridge). This bus, which looks like a train, holds passengers on the top level while cars can continue to drive beneath. The bus, travelling at about 40 kilometres an hour, will not move as fast as a car, but it will never have the problems of traffic jams. It is as wide as two lanes of the road, but it won’t slow down the traffic. It can carry 1,200 passengers, and replace up to 40 conventional buses, saving 860 tons of fuel and 2,640 tons of carbon emissions per year. As it also runs on a combination of electricity and solar power, it offers a much greener, cleaner, quieter and more economical form of transport. It is also three times faster and ten times cheaper to build than the same length of underground railway. Designed with a huge window in the top of the bus, it is also a lighter and more cheerful way to travel! The engineer has thought of everything. The bus will follow fixed routes and passengers will board the bus from stations above the ground. These stations will also recharge the bus with electricity. If you’re worried about the bus crashing into other vehicles, don’t be. A system of lights and alarms will stop this from happening. Youzhou Song has even designed escape doors which open at the side in an emergency, just like on an aeroplane.",

We lost touch when I got married and I thought I’d never see him again. That was 30 years ago. When I retired last year, I needed a new activity, especially as I had also recently got divorced, so I took up golf. One day I was going around the course alone, when I saw a man, also playing on his own. When he turned round, I realized it was my old friend! We couldn’t believe it! After that we started playing regularly. Yesterday, Roger proposed in the middle of the golf course – he’d put a ring inside a golf ball! I couldn’t believe it when I saw the ring, but I said ‘yes’!",

That's because the prescription drugs available for the flu need to be taken soon after the illness sets in although the symptoms can be eased with over the counter medications. As for colds, the sooner a person starts taking over-the-counter remedy, the sooner relief will come. Cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose and scratchy throat typically develop gradually, and adults and teens often do not get a fever. On the other hand, fever is one of the characteristic features of the flu for all ages. And in general, flu symptoms including fever and chills, sore throat and body aches come on suddenly and are more severe than cold symptoms.",

The builders must have known of geometry. They may have been influenced by the Mycenaeans, whose architecture was similar. Some of the stones must have been brought from West Wales, over 135 miles away. These stones weigh more than fifty tons. They may have been brought on rafts and rollers. Experts say that it must have taken 1500 men more than five years to transport them. Stonehenge was probably built in three stages. First, settlers from continental Europe built a temple for sun worship. Later the \"Beaker\" people added the stone circles. Finally, people of the Wesse Culture transformed Stonehenge into an observatory. They could calculate the exact time of Midsummer and Midwinter and of equinoxes.",

More seriously, there is a link between miscarriages, and pregnant women are advised to reduce their intake of tea until after their baby is born. Due to its critical side-effects, some people who like tea choose to be safer and drink a beverage from which the caffeine has been removed, decaffeinated tea, but many claim that it simply doesn't taste right.

When humans learned to make fire, however, they became capable of altering their environment. To provide themselves with fuel they stripped bark from trees, causing the trees to die. Clearings were burned in forests to increase the growth of grass and to provide a greater grazing area for the wild animals that humans fed upon. This development led to farming and the domestication of animals. Fire also provided the means for cooking plants which had previously been inedible. Only when the process of meeting the basic need for food reached a certain level of sophistication was it possible for humans to follow other pursuits such as the founding of cities.",
