About 30 countries - most of them African - can expect serious problems unless they reduce population growth and give higher priority to agriculture and conservation. Though a warmer, wetter earth with high CO2 levels is likely to be capable of producing more food, the amounts will still be inadequate for many poorer countries. In many cases, the population projections are greater than the entire local land resources can support.",

Why don’t you discuss a rota system so that you use the desk at different times? Or maybe you could study at the local library, cultural center or community center a few days a week. Make sure you’ve got storage space for everything on your desk: folders and containers for your paper and stationery. If everything has its own place, it will be easier to keep orderly. It might even be enjoyable to do this together. If it’s easier to write instead of talking face to face, try messaging her and explain how awful you feel.",

For example, a newly discovered fungal disease has been linked to the drastic decline and possible extinction of amphibians in the rain forests of Central America and Australia. Other diseases have led to the extinction of African wild dog populations and blindness of kangaroos in Australia. Since wildlife can act as a natural reservoir for diseases that are extremely virulent among humans, such as influenza and West Nile virus, as the human population expands into wildlife habitat, the conditions ripen for a new disease to emerge. Emerging infectious diseases of wildlife are caused by the spillover of pathogens from domestic animals to wildlife populations, the transport of domestic and wildlife species around the globe, and even climate change in pristine wilderness areas.",

Communications over such a vast area during the course of several centuries were, as would be expected, neither uniform nor very swift, and the dispersion of ideas and texts from one region to another was uneven. The general health of the Islamic community was influenced by many factors: the climatic conditions of the desert, marsh, mountain and littoral communities; the different living conditions of nomadic, rural, and urban populations; local economic factors and agricultural successes or failures; population migration as well as travel undertaken for commerce, for attendance at courts, or as a pilgrimage; the injuries and diseases attendant upon army camps and battles; and the incidence of plague and other epidemics as well as the occurrence of endemic conditions such as trachoma and other eye diseases.",

        "text": "Alfred Bernhard Nobel, a Swedish inventor and philanthropist, bequeathed most of his vast fortune in trust as a fund from which annual prizes could be awarded to individuals and organisations who had achieved the greatest benefit to humanity in a particular year. Originally, there were six classifications for outstanding contributions designated in Nobel’s will including, chemistry, physics, physiology or medicine, literature, and international peace. The prizes are administered by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm. In 1969, a prize for economics endowed by the Central Bank of Sweden was added. Candidates for prizes must be nominated in writing by a qualified authority in the field of competition. Recipients in physics, chemistry, and economics are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of sciences; in physiology or medicine by the Caroline Institute; in literature by the Swedish Academy; in peace by the Norwegian Nobel Committee appointed by Norway’s parliament. The prizes are all presented in Stocholm on December, 10, with the King of Sweden officiating, an appropriate tribute to Alfred Nobel on the anniversary of his death. Each one includes a gold medal, a diploma, and a cash award of about one million dollars.",

        "text": "In recent years evidence has accumulated that polyunsaturated fatty acids function in protecting humans and some laboratory animals from diseases of the arteries and heart such as atherosclerosis. In this disease, small patches of fatty material, composed mostly of cholesterol, from on the inside lining of the arteries. As the deposits increase in thickness, they may cut down on the blood flow to the organs supplied by the arteries until the structures are severely damaged. If this occurs in a branch of the coronary artery supplying the heart muscle, that portion of the muscle dies, and the person experiences a painful and sometime fatal heart attack. Another danger of atherosclerosis is that pieces of the fatty deposits may break free and travel in the bloodstream until they lodge in small vessels and block the flow of blood. This blockage may also cause heart damage, or, if it occurs in the brain, may damage cells and lead to a grave stroke.",

        "text": "Some experts think that labour by children is not productive. According to Jean Maurie Derrien, an expert at ILO (International Labour Organisation), children work power is a vicious circle and does not make nations rich, but only causes poverty. The reason is because if children work, the level of education, qualified work power or profession, and the rate of earning will get lower. The lack of healthy food, poor housing and lack of immunisation from diseases brings low working capabilities and, thus, have many impacts on children for the rest of their lives. In order to solve these problems, ILO started a program called IPEC in such developing countries as Turkey, Brazil, India, which includes serial conferences, seminars, and other activities, The program is still continuing, therefore the results are yet to come.",
